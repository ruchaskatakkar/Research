Comparison of optimization algorithms based on their performance as a function of number of iterations and solver time required to reach convergence.\
The algorithms were tested on the LASSO problem.\
Following algorithms were compared:
1. Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA)
2. Fast Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) 
3. Second Order Method of Multipliers (SOMM)
4. Forward-Backward Envelope Solver (ForBES)
